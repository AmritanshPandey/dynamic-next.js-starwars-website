        Star Wars is an American epic space opera media franchise created by
        George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly
        became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been
        expanded into various films and other media, including television
        series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and
        themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. It
        holds a Guinness World Records title for the "Most successful film
        merchandising franchise." In 2020, its total value was estimated at
        US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media
        franchise of all time.

        The original film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope
        (1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
        (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original
        Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to filmmaking to direct a
        prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999),
        Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the
        Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney,
        relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. The subsequently produced
        sequel trilogy consists of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015),
        Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of
        Skywalker (2019).

        All nine films of the 'Skywalker saga' were nominated for Academy Awards
        (with wins going to the first two released) and were commercially
        successful. Together with the theatrical live action spin-off films
        Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the
        films equates to over US$10 billion, and it is currently the
        second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.
